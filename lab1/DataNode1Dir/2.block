This makes it possible to tune deployment configurations without cluster-wide Datanode Restarts.Seeor the list of dynamically reconfigurable attributes.A lot of dependencies have been upgraded to address recent CVEs. Many of the CVEs were not actually exploitable through the Hadoop so much of this work is just due diligence. However applications which have all the library is on a class path may be vulnerable, and the ugprades should also reduce the number of false positives security scanners report.We have not been able to upgrade every single dependency to the latest version there is. Some of those changes are fundamentally incompatible. If you have concerns about the state of a specific library, consult the Apache JIRA issue tracker to see if an issue has been filed, discussions have taken place about the library in question, and whether or not there is already a fix in the pipeline. Please don’t file new JIRAs about dependency-X.Y.Z having a CVE without searching for any existing issue firstAs an open-source project, contributions in this area are always welcome, especially in testing the active branches, testing applications downstream of those branches and of whether updated dependencies trigger regressions.Hadoop HDFS is a distributed filesystem allowing remote callers to read and write data.Hadoop YARN is a distributed job submission/execution engine allowing remote callers to submit arbitrary work into the cluster.Unless a Hadoop cluster is ed w, anyone with network access to the servers has unrestricted access to the data and the ability to run whatever code they want in the system.In production, there are generally three deployment patterns which can, with care, keep data and computing resources private. 1. Physical cluster: configure Hadoop security, usually bonded to the enterprise Kerberos/Active Directory systems. Good. 1. Cloud: transient or persistent single or multiple user/tenaIf you deploy a Hadoop cluster in-cloud without security, and without configuring a VLAN to restrict access to trusted users, you are implicitly sharing your data and computing resources with anyone with network accessIf you do deploy an insecure cluster this way then port scanners will inevitably find it and submit crypto-mining jobs. If this happens to you, please do not report this as a CVE or security issue: it is utterly predictable. Secure your cluster if you want to remain exclusively your cluster.Finally, if you are using Hadoop as a service deployed/managed by someone else, do determine what security their products offer and make sure it meets your requirements.HDFS-16400, HDFS-16399, HDFS-16396, HDFS-16397, HDFS-16413, HDFS-16457.A number of Datanode configuration options can be changed without having to restart the datanode.
